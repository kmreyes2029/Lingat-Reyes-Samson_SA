            <h3>The majority language locally is Chavacano (also known as Zamboangueño). Other commonly spoken languages include Cebuano, Tagalog, English, as well as various local and migrant languages. The city has a culturally diverse population: besides the Zamboangueños, there are communities of ethnolinguistic groups such as Yakan, Sama-Bajau, Tausug, Subanen, and others–partly due to migration from the nearby islands.</h3>

            <h2>History and Significance</h2>
            <h3>The area was an early center of trade among Chinese, Malay, and native Moro peoples as early as the 13th–14th century. The Spanish founded what became Zamboanga City in 1635, and established a fort (Fort Pilar) for defense – a historical site that remains until today. Over the years, the city played a huge role as a gateway to the Sulu Archipelago and as a center of trade and defense during the colonial times. In modern times, the city is recognized as the commercial and industrial center of the wider region of Zamboanga Peninsula.</h3>
